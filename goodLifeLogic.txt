The Good Life
Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.
		Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
		Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk.
		One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
		A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
		Bear is getting some exercise.
Can you figure out what each pooch is doing? 

Tia’s Answer:
First, I’ll number each param :
	1.	Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
	2.	Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk.
	3.	One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
	4.	A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
	5.	Bear is getting some exercise.

Then, I’ll reinterpret what the parameters are saying:
Param 1 establishes Pepper’s activities as one of the following: Playing catch, burying a chew toy
Param 2 eliminates ‘on a walk’ for Ginger, Saber, and Bear
