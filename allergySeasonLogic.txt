Allergy Season
Five friends (Allegra, Ben, Clara, Flora, and Zach) are each allergic to something different: pollen, shellfish, bee stings, cats, or nuts.
Allegra has a food allergy
Ben can play with his kitten for hours without issue (or medicine).
Clara’s allergy is not related to animals.
Flora has seasonal allergies.
Can you figure out who is allergic to what?

Allegra has a food allergy. The foods listed are shellfish and nuts. Allegra is allergic to either shellfish or nuts.

Ben is not allergic to cats because he can play with his cat without an adverse reaction. 

Clara’s allergy is not related to animals. Cats are animals, therefore Clara is not allergic to cats. A shellfish is an animal too, so she’s probably not allergic to shellfish. 

Flora has seasonal allergies so, she is allergic to pollen. 

Allegra is allergic to shellfish, Ben to bee stings, Clara to nuts, Flora to pollen, and Zach to cats.
