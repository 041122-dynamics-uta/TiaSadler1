Summer Camp
Abigail, Oliver, Rosa, and Blake all attend the same summer camp, where they can cook, kayak, rock climb, and zip-line. Each child has a different favorite activity.
		Abigail’s favorite activity isn’t rock climbing.
		Oliver is afraid of heights.
		Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness.
		Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.
Can you figure out who likes what?  

Tia’s Answer:
First, I’ll number the parameters given in the logic puzzle:
		1. Abigail’s favorite activity isn’t rock climbing.
		2. Oliver is afraid of heights.
		3. Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness.
		4. Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.
		
		According to parameter 1, Abigail’s favorite activity cannot be rock climbing. Therefore, the available options are cook, kayak, and zip-line.
		Parameter 2 says Oliver is afraid of heights, ruling out activities like rock climbing and zip-lining.
		Parameter 3 states Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness, therefore she must be either rock climbing or zip lining.
		Parameter 4 indicates Blake’s activity must involve his feet touching the ground, eliminating kayak, zip-line, and rock climbing. Therefore, Blake must be cooking because it’s the only activity requiring his feet being on the ground at all times.
		
		As it stands the possibilities are: 
		
		Abigail: Zip-Line — (Cooking is eliminated because Blake is cooking, Kayaking is eliminated because Oliver is kayaking)
		Oliver: Kayak — (Cooking is eliminated because Blake is cooking)
		Rosa: Rock Climb — (Zip-lining is eliminated because Abigail is zip-lining)
		Blake: Cook — (The only activity in the list that require feet on the ground)
		
		Answer: Abigail likes to zip-line, Oliver likes to kayak, Rosa likes to rock climb, and Blake likes to cook
